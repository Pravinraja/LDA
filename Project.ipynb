      "['As a diehard Samsung fan who has had every Samsung phone since before the S series started, this has been my favorite upgrade so far. I am amazed at some of the reviews and think people may just have a defective device that needs to be replaced. The battery life is amazing.', 'Love the phone. the phone is sleek and smooth and beautiful I highly recommend the phone you will not regret getting this phone.', \"Adequate feel. Nice heft. Processor's still sluggish for the few apps that I have installed. Samsung wants to vacuum all of your data with their apps that requires more access than needed. What else is new.\", \"Never disappointed. One of the reasons I've been a long Samsung (product) consumer, they're ability to impress me with each product release. I've owned, or maintained, all Samsung smartphones starting with the S4 and the S8 is the best one yet.\", \"I've now found that i'm in a group of people that have carried their phone in their pocket without problems until the S8. Day one screen has crack from being in my pocket. Bluetooth on my 1st trip struggles to stay connected. Good news.....battery life is great and lots of great features.\", 'I am the type of person who never would completely be sold on a phone I really was not into Samsung until the S7 (Before that I had a Galaxy Nexus, but that was a Google phone). I got the S7 because at the time the fries made the most sense for me.', 'The way this Samsung S8 phone operates is more cumbersome than my previous phone, HTC M9. When making a call you must select phone and then select the dial pad. It should automatically go to the dial pad.', 'I bought this phone very excited to use it. I agree with all the other reviews stating that trying to use a glass screen protector with it is a nightmare. I have so far has 2 different screen protectors on it and both times they have made it difficult for me to tap on the screen.', \"It is an extremely advanced and truly a Smart phone. Great apps, great look. BUT, the durability is that of a fresh egg. Don't consider this phone without insurance. The screen is fragile and one crack voids warranty. Won't buy another Samsung based on their lack of support for a poor design.\", 'Great phone with a PHENOMENAL Camera, not all that hard to get use to. However the screen IS NOT 5.8,\" it\\'s not all that bigger than my S7 Edge. So maybe a 5.6\" screen, it just looks bigger cus it\\'s not as wide as my S7 Edge, takes amazing pictures.', \"I initially wasn't 100% certain about this handset, coming from the Nexus line I am very much used to a stock Android OS, I was worried about bloatware and various other things Samsung would add.\", \"this arrived a week before it's release date, very happy with it. Features are good, light weight and great screen resolution.\", \"I traded in my galaxy s6 for this one and I don't regret it. The battery is long lasting despite all the mindless scrolling I do on instagram and facebook. The images and photos look outstanding.\", 'I have always been a Samsung fan, especially with their phones. Unfortunately, the S8, in my opinion, is no flagship phone. The S7 Edge is still the winner in my book. Here is why I feel the way I do. The tactile button on the home screen is cumbersome, as is the Bixby button on the side.', \"Took the risk and bought this phone and I must say it is impressive in every aspect. I was skeptical at first cause I've spend the last 3 years with Apple hardware and software being the latter my primary concern coming in.\", \"I moved from the S7 Edge and love this phone. I think the cons regarding the fingerprint scanner are wrong. I've had very little problem with the combination of the fingerprint and IRIS scanner. They work fine most of the time.\", \"I love the phone but there are some glitches. When I go to put in my pattern to unlock the phone, it unlocks before I'm done. I keep getting a pop up that says DQA stopped working (whatever that is). Few other things but over all it's a great phone.\", 'This phone makes everything so easy to learn.', 'This is my third Galaxy S phone. It is amazing.', 'Battery life is great, but it would be better without the curved edge.', \"The S8 is a more elegant than the iPhone. It does more. It allows me to set up the phone as I want it. I love it. I have been an Apple user for 22 years. It is possible to leave the mothership. I'm proof of that. Goodbye Apple.\", 'Love the camera.. Love the phone', 'Phone is graet. Love it. U should get on too.', \"The Iphone 7+ is a good phone but the S8 is truly amazing. . . can't believe I'm saying that about a galaxy. Fast, snappy and the camera blows 7+ out of the water. Battery life is finally able to keep up a full 12 hours of hard use.\", 'Move from iphone 6s to this s8.. amazing screen and futures... iphone is rubbish compare to samsung s8...', 'BUYER BEWARE: My wife and I both upgraded to the s8, we were big galaxy people. We loved the new phones until this weekend when both phones ended up with huge cracks, and seriously we have not dropped the phones at all. I went through the s5, 6, and 7 withhout cases and never had an issue.', \"I was so excited to upgrade from the galaxy s6 but was quickly disappointed. I have a 2 month old son so a good camera is super important to me. And since the galaxy s6's camera was amazing I didn't expect newest galaxy to disappoint, I was actually expecting a far better camera.\", 'This phone is admittedly breathtaking however it cannot survive even the simplest of mishaps. Both a close friend of mine and myself have broken ours within the first two weeks of receiving them. Mine feel from less than 2 feet and shattered the ENTIRE screen.', 'Simply the best phone by far. Loving it :)', 'I do not like this phone. I had it in my pocket with something else and the screen protector cracked. Replaced it and it has another crack in it. They need to do something different', 'I love my new phone it really have lot great new features!!', \"Great phone. Very easy to manage. I do miss a few features that were on my old phone, but nothing I can't adjust too.\", \"Its good, but there are some things to not like. The Bixby button is in the way and Bixby doesn't work anyway. The finger print scanner is in an awkward location and so far I find the face recognition to be less than effective. What light you are in seems to make a big difference.\", 'Phone is great! It works just as I expected.', 'I have been truly impressed with the new Samsung Galaxy S8. It feels great in my hand. It very easy to read from It is incredibly responsive both to the touch and in changing sites. And, of course, the screen and picture on it are outstanding. I an a Samsung guy. This just helps me to stay one.', \"I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks. So still getting used to the new features. Don't know for sure if I like or use the edge screen or folders. Still a lot of preloaded apps that I'll never use and can't take off. Disappointed I can't get a screen cover that will work with a case.\", 'Data issues immediately. Tech dept. Is going to get back to me.', 'If you are looking up this phone for reviews then you already have heard that it is a pretty good phone. I bought the S8 after a lot of research and anticipation but I was still blown away by everything that the phone offers.', 'Nice phone. Was worried about all the glass but not a problem. Love the fingerprint reader, works great.', 'Nice phone but wireless charger does not work', \"I'm. Still getting used to it. I had an S6 so there are changes. This GPS is working better. What I Don't like so far are the battery overheating shut downs. As soon as it gets a bit warm, I can't use the camera.\", 'Love the phone, EXCEPT, no infrared to use tv remote apps. That sucks, and now I have to carry my 5S as well.', 'Not since the HTC M1 have I been this impressed with with a new flagship phone. I love everything about this device.', 'No regrets about this phone', \"Finely Samsung has hit it out of the park with this new S8, Simply outstanding not buggy i'm believeable pictures\", \"I haven't found anything negative about it yet. The camera takes beautiful clear pictures. It has plenty of memory. I just lover it.\", \"We all know what's great about the phone by now and it is fantastic. There is only one thing I have found thus far that annoys me, the bixby button. I hit it all the time on accident and it lights up the phone even when locked. I'm hoping this will be fixed.\", 'Had the Galaxy S5 and thought it was time to uograde. The S8 has a larger screen and takes good pictures but honestly I think the S5 is every bit as good and in fact I like its size better. In my personal opinion I wish I had stayed with the S5 instead of dishing out the money for a new phone.', 'Needed to get used to it but I really like it', 'Best cell phone I ever owned.', 'The curved edge makes it a little difficult to tap anything that might be on that edge. The other big issue with this phone so far, is that the Gadget Guard protective cover that AT&T sells for it will not stay on and can be broken with literally NO effort.', 'Love it!! Battery could last longer but phone is great!!!', 'I bought the Samsung s8 a few days after it came on market and so far I am very very happy. The phone is easy to use and is as described. I recently bought a wireless charger too and am having no issues with the wireless charging (so far).', 'This phone is great. If you can get one, do. Camera is awesome, functions are easy. Waaaaaay better than Apple. Also Very have ways to allow you to pay for the phone over time and/or their but now and pay later scheme. Thoroughly recommend.', \"Bought the S4 because it was revolutionary. Now I've bought the S8 for the same reason. Absolutely amazing phone. Can't get my hands of it.\", \"Arrived next day can't be more happier with the phone and with the service and I had prom code for extra Â£50 discount it :) I'll stay with you very for ever\", \"The S8 is a great phone, I cannot fault it at all.

The screen without a doubt is so beautiful. Even though it is a big 5.8 inch screen it only has a similar footprint as my P9.

black and white screen and cant take photos and is only dual band  but sometimes simple is best', 'I bought my phone last year to keep in touch with my parents when im out I bought it for Â2999 from the vodafone shop It wasnt new but had been fully reconditioned which means that all the parts inside are newThere is not many special features on this phone the only points worth mentioning are', 'I

are', 'I first bought a MN1 the slightly altered version when I wanted my first pay as you talk phone And I cant emphisise enough the Â30 I spent on it was Â30 too much Any way thats enough about that The Maxon MN1 is a basic phone available on Vodafone if you can still find one', 'When my mom gave me some money to buy my very first mobile phone I chose this unit because it actually caught my site It is indeed attractive to look at its small enough the shape fits good on one hand and its color is very nice It also says that it has a 4liners display', 'Unlike the picture on this page The Maxon is not small it is not good It is a four line text only display It is very heavy and not particuly easy to use  the laberenth of menus does not help the matter Although it isnt perfect it is very cheap and comes in a range of colours', 'This phone is OK Its very basic and does a job I got this phone when I bought a Vodafone Pay As You Talk last year and my phone is nearly a year old and is still working perfectly The battery life is quite short mine needs charged every 36 hours I hate the display', 'This is an alright phone It really isnt very special it just does a job and nothing else My major gripe is the display it looks very dated and eightieslike Saying that it is easy to use The battery life isnt great it needs recharged every night', 'Dont bother even considering to buy one of these there heavy ugly they always screw up on you I have got one the volume control has come off the charging port has snapped the sim reader is so dodgey its unbeliveable the antanna has snapped this is my third and this one has snapped the battery comes', 'The phone in the picture unless they have changed it is actually a nice little ericsson  The Maxon itself is a chunky piece of plastic with the basic function of allowing you to talk without a phone line ie it is a mobile phone ', 'Having recently bought a Maxon Vodafone phone MN1 I was very excitied at the possibilities that this phone had to offer me The phone itself is a payasyougo phone and constantly needs topping up with money', 'I recently bought a Vodafone MN1 a slightly altered 3204 the buttons are different on UK Vodafone PaYT Ive owned this phone for only a few weeks and it hasnt let me down I admit its not really the best phone ever made but for a first phone or a cheap phone for teenagers it really
